          The tech industry experienced seismic shifts between late 2022 and 2024. While 2022 was marked by economic challenges, with over 150,000 tech layoffs and tech stocks plummeting by over 30%, a groundbreaking innovation emerged, reshaping the narrative of technological advancement.

          On November 30, 2022, OpenAI launched ChatGPT-3.5, introducing the world to an AI capable of generating detailed, human-like responses to questions and tasks. Within just five days, the game-changer amassed 1 million users, highlighting the hunger for innovative technology amidst a struggling tech sector. For many, ChatGPT represented a paradigm shift. Unlike earlier assistants like Siri, which offered basic functionality, ChatGPT provided deep, contextualized, and intelligent responses. It wasn’t just a tool—it was a collaborator.



          2023: The Year of GPT-4 and Rising Concerns
          On March 14, 2023, OpenAI followed up with GPT-4, a multimodal AI model that accepted both text and image inputs. GPT-4 showcased extraordinary abilities, including passing a simulated bar exam with scores in the top 10% of test takers. It could perform complex vision and language tasks, elevating AI's potential across diverse industries.

          As GPT-4's capabilities stunned the world, concerns about the risks of advanced AI intensified. On March 22, 2023, a group of prominent tech leaders, including Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak, published the “Pause Giant AI Experiments” open letter, urging a six-month moratorium on training AI systems more powerful than GPT-4. Their appeal highlighted the need to ensure that AI development benefits humanity while managing its risks responsibly.

          Despite these concerns, on July 11, 2023, Bloomberg reported that OpenAI announced five steps to achieve artificial intelligence (AGI) that will outperform human capabilities. 

          OpenAI’s 5 Levels Of ‘Super AI’

          Level 1 Conversational AI: Basic dialogue with users (e.g., ChatGPT).

          Level 2 Reasoning AI: Human-like logical reasoning for decision-making.

          Level 3 Autonomous AI: AI agents capable of independently operating for extended periods.

          Level 4 Innovating AI: Systems that can generate original ideas and innovations.

          Level 5 Organizational AI: AI capable of managing and running entire organizations.

          By mid-2023, OpenAI indicated that technology was approaching Level 2 (Reasoning AI), paving the way for more advanced applications.


          OpenAI’s 5 Levels Of ‘Super AI’
          A major upheaval occurred in November 2023 when Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, was unexpectedly dismissed by the company’s board. The decision shocked the tech world, leading to intense backlash from employees, investors, and partners. After a dramatic five days, Altman returned to his role as CEO and restructured OpenAI’s governance by creating an entirely new board. As of late 2024, only three of the original 11 co-founders remain at the company.



          2024: A Year of Breakthroughs
          On May 13, 2024, OpenAI introduced GPT-4o (“o” for “omni”), a multilingual, multimodal model capable of processing text, vision, and audio. This marked a shift from chasing "the next big leap" (like GPT-5) to refining and optimizing AI capabilities.

          On September 12, 2024, the release of GPT-o1 surprised the AI community with its ability to mimic human thought processes. It demonstrated the ability to "think" before responding to complex queries, dramatically improving its performance in reasoning, coding, analysis, and mathematical problem-solving. For instance, GPT-o1 significantly advanced in competitive programming, achieving high efficiency in solving algorithmic challenges.

          OpenAI concluded the year with its “12 Days of OpenAI” PR event, revealing a series of groundbreaking advancements: The full release of GPT-o1, the unveiling of Sora (a text-to-video model), and the introduction of Canvas, enabling users to collaborate in real-time on creative projects.

          The highlight came on December 20, 2024, with the announcement of GPT-o3 and o3-mini. These models surpassed o1 in delivering step-by-step logical reasoning. Early evaluations showed GPT-o3 scoring a 2727 rating on Codeforces (a competitive programming platform) and achieving 96.7% accuracy on AIME 2024 mathematics problems, demonstrating its practical utility in complex problem-solving domains.




          AI Players
          OpenAI stands as a pioneering force in the AI landscape, largely due to their groundbreaking release of ChatGPT and GPT-4. Their $13 billion partnership with Microsoft has provided them with substantial resources, while their first-mover advantage has helped establish a robust developer ecosystem. While OpenAI dominated headlines, other key players in the AI industry made significant strides during this period.

          Anthropic developed Claude, an AI model focused on alignment and safety. One of Claude's greatest assets is its ability to understand and manipulate complex concepts (like code), which is very popular for Developers and Technical Users.

          Google launched Gemini 2.0 to make information much more useful, Gemini 2.0 Flash thinking to generate thinking process, Veo 2 generates video from a text prompt, Project Astra: a real-time, multimodal AI assistant that can see the world, knows what things are and where you left them, and can answer questions or help you do almost anything. NotebookLM is an innovative tool for quick summarization and note-taking, a breakthrough in long-context understanding that can handle up to two million tokens much better than the normal 10-20k token limits. What’s more, Google published “Leave No Context Behind: Efficient Infinite Context Transformers with Infini-attention” which includes a new attention technique dubbed Infini-attention.

          Meta introduced LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI), a family of open-access language models aimed at fostering transparency and innovation in the AI community. Their massive social media platforms provide unique access to training data. Besides, Meta’s LCM (Large Concept Models) work with language- and modality-agnostic representations of higher-level ideas or actions compared to traditional LLMs (Large Language Models). Instead of word-by-word prediction, the model predicts the next idea or concept.

          xAI, founded by Elon Musk, represents an interesting addition to the AI landscape. The first model, Grok, was trained with real-time access to X (formerly Twitter) data, giving it unique capabilities in understanding current events and casual conversation. The chatbot is advertised as having a "sense of humor" and direct access to X.

          In the open-source space, Hugging Face’s community-driven approach and comprehensive model repository have made them essential to the democratization of AI technology. Their developer-friendly tools have become standard resources in the AI community.

          The Chinese tech giants: Baidu’s ERNIE Bot primary large language model, Alibaba’s Multimodal large language model Tongyi Qianwen, and Tencent’s Hunyuan-powered AI assistant - hold significant advantages in their domestic market. Their access to vast amounts of Chinese language data, combined with strong government support, positions uniquely in the global AI landscape. Their deep integration with local services provides them with practical applications at a massive scale.

          Together, these advancements from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, xAI, Hugging Face and so on reflected a vibrant and competitive AI landscape, each player contributing unique perspectives and innovations to the field.



          A Transformative Era
          In just two years, AI advanced from Conversational AI to Reasoning AI, with the promise of reaching Autonomous AI in the near future. Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO, predicts the realization of Level 5 (Organizational AI) within a decade. Other experts estimate this milestone might occur by 2030 or take several decades longer.



          What’s Next?
          The future of AI remains uncertain but deeply exciting. While the rapid pace of development raises ethical and societal questions, it also offers immense possibilities. As we walk this uncharted path, the direction AI takes will depend heavily on the choices we make—how we develop, regulate, and apply these transformative technologies.

          One thing is certain: AI is reshaping the world at an unprecedented speed, and its journey is far from over.",
